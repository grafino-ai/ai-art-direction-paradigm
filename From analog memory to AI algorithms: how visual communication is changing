From Analog Memory to AI Algorithms: How Visual Communication is Changing
What happens when Artificial Intelligence enters the workflow of visual communicators who have been doing this job since the days of transfer sheets?

Those who, like me, grew up with Letraset, screen tones, manual layouts, and the first composition interfaces, today find themselves facing images born in seconds, with a facility we would have called science fiction not long ago. A true short circuit between analog memory and the digital future.

I perfectly remember the hours spent manually positioning a screen tone to create a sheet of perfect squares. I moved it delicately to avoid irregularities. Today, the same pattern can be generated in one second: two distant worlds coexisting on the same desk.

However, this is not just a technological leap; it is a genuine paradigm shift. We are not moving from one software to another, but from a craft centered on execution to one founded on choice and direction.

This shift compels us to rethink what it means to "create" in an era where visual production is potentially infinite.

Training as a Choice of Responsibility
When AI entered my work processes, I realized I couldn't just improvise. To be used professionally, it had to be understood more deeply. So, I chose to train. Not to learn "how to generate images," but to understand the logic behind the model: how it "thinks," what biases it contains.

This study led me to a simple and fundamental awareness: if you do not guide AI with criteria, it will lead you toward the average—toward a standardized aesthetic. That is its nature: it generates based on what already exists. And what already exists, by definition, is not new.

This clashes with a central necessity of our profession: the need to deviate from standards, not to repeat them.

Drawing with Words: The New Art Direction Skill
Throughout this evolution, I acquired a skill that I never thought would become so central: drawing with words, using language as a full-fledged design tool.

Writing a prompt is not a magic formula; it is the natural evolution of the brief. Asking for the right thing in the right way is the design gesture through which art direction redefines itself, becoming a new way of using visual thinking.

I no longer spend most of my time fixing pixels and vectors, but deciding which atmosphere makes sense, what direction an intention should take, and how to ensure a message is coherent through visual choices.

AI as the Ikea of Creativity
The fact that anyone can generate "beautiful" images in seconds is a given. But "beautiful" is not enough to be "right" in a communication project with marketing objectives.

Without a strategic vision to guide it, AI becomes the Ikea of visual creativity.

Certainly, it democratizes creation, making it accessible with incredible ease, but it hides the trap of homogenization. Just as Ikea furniture offers aesthetically pleasing but pre-packaged solutions that tend to create similar environments, an uncritical use of generative tools produces a visual landscape based on compositions that belong to the same aesthetic matrix. Unless, behind it, there is a creative mind capable of modifying, reinventing, and personalizing.

The problem is not the simplicity, but the substitution of personal vision with the easier assembly of generic "creative objects." Conversely, when AI is guided by a solid visual background and a precise point of view, it stops proposing "Billy bookshelves" and becomes the raw material for building a distinctive visual language.

For example: if you ask the AI for a "photo of a gourmet dish," you get the usual international food porn output—impeccable but anonymous. But if the prompt is "adv for premium fresh pasta brand, imperfect dish, visible steam, dark wood table, minimal props, reinterpreted 80s Italian home kitchen style," the image doesn't just change aesthetically; it changes intention, positioning, and tone. It begins to speak of a specific brand, not a generic trend.

In essence, AI is like Ikea when you ask it for the minimum, but it can become "Architecture" when you know what you want.

Experience as the Critical Filter: The Value That Cannot Be Generated
The years spent curating compositions, measuring visual coherence down to the millimeter, and understanding why one choice works and another does not, are more useful today than ever. They are the barrier against worthless creative shortcuts.

It often happens to me, working with AI, that I discard "perfect," even fascinating, outputs because they don't say what they need to say.

It is thanks to experience that we can:

Recognize clichés where the algorithm only sees immediate solutions;

Avoid visual trivialization, a result of training based on the statistical average of existing productions;

Distinguish a pleasing output from a real and functional project;

Force the AI off the standard rails to explore unprecedented visual territories;

Transform pure speed into direction, for a workflow optimization that never loses sight of the meaning.

The future of professional creativity has already arrived, compelling us to redefine our role, in a Human-driven, AI-executed logic where the capacity to generate images does not count, but the capacity to decide which ones deserve to exist does.
